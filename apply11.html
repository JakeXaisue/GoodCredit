			We live in a world where having a good credit can go a long way. A good credit gives you more opportunity in life vs. a bad credit. With a good credit, banks are more willing to loan you the money you need whether it be for a car, a mortgage, a boat, or personal reasons. Building your credit at a young age (18yrs) is best. There are many different ways to acquire a good credit. When it comes to building a good credit, it can be tricky. Here are some tips that can help you get started: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Always make sure you pay your bills on time.</li>
			<li>Limit yourself up to two credit cards at a time.</li>
			<li>Only take out credit lines that you can afford to pay back.</li>
			<li>Having too much credit inquires can have a negative impact on your credit.</li>
			<li>Use a co-signer with a good credit and make sure it is okay by them. This can help boost your credit and lower your interest rate.</li>
